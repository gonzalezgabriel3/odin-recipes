             cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining
              salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according 
            to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with 
            mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the
